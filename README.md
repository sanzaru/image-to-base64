# Image To Base64 Encoder

This is the repository for the ImageToBase64 app which can be found on the [Mac App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/image-to-base64-encoder/id1479205687). 


## 📌 Description
ImageToBase64 is a simple, secure, fast and free to use image encoding utility that lets you encode your local image files to base64 code for use in HTML image tags, emails, web pages.

### Project goals:

- **👍 Simple:** Simply drag & drop your image on the app window or dock icon - that's all. It just works.
